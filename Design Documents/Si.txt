The game is a sim city style game

There are planets and you build in a square.
Later planets could be bigger, more resources to colonize.
Connecting to the edge of a square connects it to the neighbor.
A connected city is added to the simulation.



When you colonize a planet it gives you several layout options that change the way the city performs.
Example Layout

Areas can give boosts to resource extraction, Zone density, Output, Rare resources.
Rare resources can be used to create special buildings.





Specialized Cities

Population Demand
If it is positive people will move to the city into residential areas and fill the open housing.
The people are hard capped at the Commerce limit.

A city center is built
Everything that is in the city needs a connection to the city center
That will connect it to the hub system of that city

A city center can upgrade to allow higher density population, and advanced tech.
As city centers upgrade they can take different paths that will specialize the center. 

City centers need to be connected by Highways, Railways, other transit.
They will bring resources back and forth between the areas.






Every tile 3x out from the road is checked and added to the road network, Assumed that at some point the road is going to be used.
The road holds the resources Jobs + Products + Commerce
