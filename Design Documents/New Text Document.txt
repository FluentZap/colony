A city center is built at the start.
Any roads that are built must be connected to the city center to function.
There is a capacity limit based on the road level.
All the roads in a district are of the same road level.
Traffic over the capacity will decrees the efficiency of the district.

Highways, Railways and other large scale transportation are used to connect districts to each other to transport products, jobs, commerce.

Road Networks

A road network connects all plots to each other

There is a maximum transportation amount per road type, when




Will index all roads 



Lend Desire 	Depends on the type of building
	Service Access
	J/P/C Access, Level

Stops cover an area








Production

Resource Sites
Can have production buildings built there that produce resources.
They can then be transported to industry buildings that process into stuff.

A district is built as a standard Level 1 District.
Can upgrade into a Level 2 District, 

Specialized Districts for RCI


local (2-lane roads)
connecting (4- and 6-lanes)

Traffic Maps Crawl from Point of Highest Traffic
The Traffic 

Starts a Route
Route adds all traffic to it that it touches stops at traffic 0, Then starts a crawl at another point.
Adds as Output/Input

Set's the Traffic to what the last was 









Just get it working and not do traffic yet.

Just take max jobs in city.


STEPS


Make cool Robot upgrade/modify system.

Science Window.

District Transit.







Jobs / Job Demand Gives 	Production %

Production * Products = Products



Basic People Satisfaction is Commerce supply to the population and services level.


Services that people like

Basic Buildings that provide services.


Primary School 		Brings no education numbers to low
Secondary School	Brings low education numbers to medium
University			Brings medium education numbers to high



Parks
	Increases beautification that makes people in it's range use less Commerce.
	Increases Land Value
Education			3 separate levels
	Primary School
	Secondary School
	University
Water/Sewage		Runs on the road, needs a connection to run.
	Primary need for population. They will leave if there is no water.	
Waste Management
	Garbage will pile up unless collected by a garbage center.
	Commerce turns into it after it is used and it's a byproduct from making Products.	
Fire
	Fire risk will burn down zones buildings, Prevents fire danger.
Police
	Police will cause a slowdown to Products, Commerce, Move in rates.
Telecommunications
	Increases education levels.
	Possible Could boost everything
Public Transportation
	
Health Care
	(Simulates Longer Lives)
	Increases Move in rates.
	Decrease education falloff.	



Buildings have a fixed cost, 


	
	
Public Buildings
	Governors Mansion		Allow a Governor to be Hired.
Courts
	Increases tax rates
	


R	If there are jobs there is R demand. Multiplied by People Satisfaction.

Traffic is crawled and sprawls out from it's start

Every tile has an origin tile.

All the Suppliers are added to a list.
They cycle and sprawl out from origin point.

First the Job Calculation is done.
Then Industry
Then Commerce
Taking into account slower paths.




People want to move in if there is

Jobs
Needs are met

Commerce is spent to make people happy,
100% commerce gives max growth.
