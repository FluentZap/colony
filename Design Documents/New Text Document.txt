A city center is built at the start.
Any roads that are built must be connected to the city center to function.
There is a capacity limit based on the road level.
All the roads in a district are of the same road level.
Traffic over the capacity will decrees the efficiency of the district.

Highways, Railways and other large scale transportation are used to connect districts to each other to transport products, jobs, commerce.

Road Networks

A road network connects all plots to each other

There is a maximum transportation amount per road type, when

Traffic Maps Crawl from Point of Highest Traffic
The Traffic 

Starts a Route
Route adds all traffic to it that it touches stops at traffic 0, Then starts a crawl at another point.
Adds as Output/Input

Set's the Traffic to what the last was 


Set Zones as Connected
Crawl out from connected zones with the least amount of jumps.
Cycle until all tiles are added.
