A city center is built at the start.
Any roads that are built must be connected to the city center to function.
There is a capacity limit based on the road level.
All the roads in a district are of the same road level.
Traffic over the capacity will decrees the efficiency of the district.

Highways, Railways and other large scale transportation are used to connect districts to each other to transport products, jobs, commerce.

Road Networks

A road network connects all plots to each other

There is a maximum transportation amount per road type, when

Production

Resource Sites
Can have production buildings built there that produce resources.
They can then be transported to industry buildings that process into stuff.

Can upgrade into a Level 2 District,

Traffic Maps Crawl from Point of Highest Traffic
The Traffic 

Starts a Route
Route adds all traffic to it that it touches stops at traffic 0, Then starts a crawl at another point.
Adds as Output/Input

Set's the Traffic to what the last was 









Just get it working and not do traffic yet.

Just take max jobs in city.


STEPS

Basic People Satisfaction is Commerce supply to the population and services level.


Services that people like

Basic Buildings that provide services.


Primary School 		Brings no education numbers to low
Secondary School	Brings low education numbers to medium
University			Brings medium education numbers to high



Parks
	Increases beautification that makes people in it's range use less Commerce.
	Increases Land Value
Education			3 separate levels
	Primary School
	Secondary School
	University
Water/Sewage		Runs on the road, needs a connection to run.
	Primary need for population. They will leave if there is no water.	
Waste Management
	Garbage will pile up unless collected by a garbage center.
	Commerce turns into it after it is used and it's a byproduct from making Products.	
Fire
	Fire risk will burn down zones buildings, Prevents fire danger.
Police
	Police will cause a slowdown to Products, Commerce, Move in rates.
Telecommunications
	Increases education levels.
	Possible Could boost everything
Public Transportation
	
Health Care
	(Simulates Longer Lives)
	Increases Move in rates.
	Decrease education falloff.	



Buildings have a fixed cost, 


	
	
Public Buildings
	Governors Mansion		Allow a Governor to be Hired.
Courts
	Increases tax rates
	


R	If there are jobs there is R demand. Multiplied by People Satisfaction.

Needs are met

Commerce is spent to make people happy,
100% commerce gives max growth.

Redesign of City Growing


RCI has a build meter for each zone that builds to a cap
Primary Level Zones will gain a steady amount



Tax is generated by residential going to commercial



Commercial		does not have products/workers				Relies on Residential/Industrial
Residential		does not have jobs							Relies on Commercial/Industrial
Industrial		does not have workers						Relies on Residential


Population has Wealth and Educations factors

Only low density is available at the start

Game unlocks higher density zone sizes.


Build strategies
Build Tall and have a small but strong empire.
Build Wide and have large access to resources and verity, also lots of workers/population.


What would be cool!
Clones 			That would make lots of low wealth workers
Cyborgs
Androids

Abjuration - may be the same thing as ward magic … or reverse conjuration or reverse invocation … or not.
Alchemy - which may or may not count as magic
Apportation - transport magic, sometimes a speciality of summoning, conjuration or something similar.
Artifice - the creation of magical technology or just magic items.
Binding magic - perhaps a subschool of invocation or ward magic.
Biothaumaturgy - may be a subschool of healing or vice versa.
Charm magic - usually mind effecting magic rather than the creation of luck charms and the like.
Conjuration magic - making things appear. Sometimes the same as summon magic and the like. Often for summoning inanimate objects only.
Divination
Elemental Magic
Enchantment - a name much fought over. Sometimes the same as artifice and sometimes the same as charm magic.
Evocation - usually associated with big, showy effects and gratuitous RPG magic like lightning and fireballs.
Healing Magic
Illusion - sometimes a subset of charm magic, or at least overlapping in places.
Invocation - summon magic that takes the creatures summoned seriously.
Nature Magic
Necromancy
Scrying
Thaumaturgy aka. "Meta-magic".
Transmutation
Transformation
Ward Magic - protective barrier magic, sometimes the same as abjuration.

Functional Magic
Blood Magic
Magical Tradition
Thaumatology - arguably a lot more likely where magic can be this rigidly defined.

Population Markers unlock access to buildings and strategies.
This could be
large populations
high wealth populations
high education populations

Markers for population,
Districts have calculations for 

Population are different types.

Most Population has

Wealth
Education


Residential can be built at will. Unemployment contributes to unhappiness.
Happiness has tiers and the higher the tier the more population can increase.
The max population influx is based on the total population of a city. With possible boost for other cities on the planet/connected trade routes/gates.




Education does not make higher wealth for residential but will prompt upgrades for industrial buildings.
Wealth of population increases the need for higher level commercial.



There are types of education
They have education limits,


As other population types become available they have higher education caps.
There is only one education type but the population type dictates the Cap and what is required to upgrade.


Base Wealth and Wealth Cap is different based on the Population type.

Population creates jobs,

Education buildings slowly raises education and promotes population to higher education classes.
Education level of workers is a large factor in an industry leveling up.

Wealth determines what commercial building demand is.

Commerce	$		$$				$$$
