RCI Calculation


Basic Demand Theory



Terms

Max Growth Rate		The maximum amount a district can grow a day.
Commerce Supply		Percentage of supplied commerce to demand.





"Perfect RCI"


-----Residential-----
Max Growth Rate 		= Residential Demand * 5

Residential Demand 		= Available Jobs * ((Commerce Supply% - 0.5) * 2)




-----Commercial-----
Commercial Demand		= Commerce Demand - Commerce Supply




-----Industrial-----
Industrial Demand		= Products Demand - Products Supply + Unemployed Residential * ((Commerce Supply% - 0.5) * 2)
