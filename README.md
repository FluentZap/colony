A roguelike city builder using Monogame framework


## Current state
In this WIP city builder the user can build a city center and place roads.
This will open up area to city zones, Residential Commercial and Industrial.

In the current build the low wealth low density residential buildings will always build but nobody will move into them until there are jobs to go to.
Industrial supply is only created when there is demand from commercial buildings.
Commercial demand is generated by population demand for commerce.

High density residential can be created by having a high demand for residential and no space for them.

All of the current game mechanics are subject to change
Be aware this is a very early alpha development build and many things might not work or have errors
